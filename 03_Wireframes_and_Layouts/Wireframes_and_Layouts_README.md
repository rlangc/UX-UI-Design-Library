# Wireframes and Layouts

This section includes examples and templates for low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes, along with guidance on layout structure, spacing, and visual hierarchy. Wireframes are essential blueprints that translate user needs into tangible screen designs before full visual styling is applied.

## 📊 What Are Wireframes?

Wireframes are simplified, skeletal outlines of UI layouts used early in the design process to:

- Define information architecture.
- Validate navigation flow and user journeys.
- Communicate structure and functionality without distractions from color or imagery.

## ✍️ Types of Wireframes

### 1. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**
- Hand-drawn or grayscale sketches.
- Focused on layout, grouping, and basic interaction.
- Great for quick iteration and feedback.

### 2. **High-Fidelity Wireframes**
- Polished and detailed with real or placeholder content.
- Include accurate spacing, fonts, and UI components.
- Closer to final product mockups but without full branding.

## 🧠 Best Practices for Layout Design

- Use a consistent grid system (e.g., 8pt or 4pt spacing).
- Prioritize content with visual hierarchy (headlines > body > labels).
- Align elements to reduce visual noise.
- Leave ample white space to support scannability.
