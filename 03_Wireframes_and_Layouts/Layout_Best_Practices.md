# Layout Best Practices

Effective UI layout is the foundation of usable and intuitive digital products. A strong layout creates clarity, consistency, and a smooth visual flow, helping users accomplish tasks with minimal friction.

---

## 📐 1. Use a Grid System

- Establish a consistent grid (e.g., 8pt or 12-column grid).
- Align text, images, and components to columns and rows.
- Maintain visual rhythm with consistent padding and spacing.

### 💡 Tip:
Use auto-layout or constraints in Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch to maintain structure as the design scales.

---

## 👀 2. Establish Visual Hierarchy

- Use size, color, weight, and position to signal importance.
- Headlines should stand out clearly from body text.
- Use whitespace to group related content.

### Examples:
- Large, bold titles for key sections.
- Button prominence for primary actions.
- Subtle styling for secondary info.

---

## 🎯 3. Prioritize the Primary Action

- Make the main CTA (Call to Action) visible and accessible.
- Use placement (e.g., bottom-right on mobile), size, and color to emphasize.
- Avoid competing buttons of equal weight on the same screen.

---

## 📱 4. Design for Mobile First

- Start with the smallest screen and scale up.
- Use stacked layouts and collapsible menus for small screens.
- Ensure tap targets are at least 44px x 44px (Apple) or 48dp (Android).

---

## 🧭 5. Maintain Consistency

- Use a design system or component library to standardize:
  - Spacing (e.g., 4pt/8pt increments)
  - Typography styles
  - Button sizes and behavior
  - Navigation and icon placement

---

## ✅ 6. Keep It Scannable

- Use headings, bullets, and short paragraphs.
- Avoid dense blocks of text or cluttered sections.
- Support scanning with visual dividers and section labels.

---

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Misaligned elements or inconsistent spacing.
- Excessive use of bold, color, or capital letters.
- Overuse of carousels or hidden navigation patterns.
- Ignoring accessibility guidelines for contrast and spacing.
