# Figma Files and Export Guides

Figma is a powerful, browser-based interface design tool used for wireframing, prototyping, and building design systems. This guide provides best practices for organizing your Figma files and exporting assets for development and documentation.

## 📁 Organizing Figma Files

### 🔲 1. Use Pages Strategically
Organize work across pages for clarity:
- `Cover` – Title and metadata
- `Wireframes` – Low-fidelity concepts
- `Mockups` – High-fidelity screens
- `Prototypes` – Interactive flows
- `Components` – Design system elements

### 📐 2. Use Frames and Layout Grids
- Name frames clearly (e.g., “Login - Desktop”).
- Use consistent layout grids for responsiveness.
- Group frames by flow or screen type.

### 🏷️ 3. Label Layers and Components
- Keep your layer names clean and intuitive.
- Use grouping for nested elements.
- Apply text and color styles for consistency.

## 🔄 Exporting from Figma

### 🖼️ Exporting Assets
- Select any element or frame > Right-click > “Export”.
- Choose format: PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF.
- Set resolution: 1x, 2x (for retina), or custom.
- Use “Export to ZIP” for grouped assets.

### 🧱 Exporting Design Systems
- Share styles and components via Libraries.
- Use “Team Library” to sync tokens across files.
- Export documentation using Zeroheight or Notion.

## 🔗 Sharing & Embedding

- Share public or restricted view links (with or without edit access).
- Use “Present” mode for interactive demos.
- Embed Figma files in Notion, Confluence, or web documentation.

## ✅ Tips for Developer Handoff

- Use **Inspect mode** to expose code-friendly details (CSS, iOS, Android).
- Add developer notes or tooltips to components.
- Group related screens into flows with arrows.
- Mark final versions with color-coded headers or tags.
