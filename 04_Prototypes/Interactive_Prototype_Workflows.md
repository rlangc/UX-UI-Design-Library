# Interactive Prototype Workflows

Interactive prototypes simulate how users will interact with a digital product before it‚Äôs built. They are essential for usability testing, design validation, stakeholder communication, and development handoff.

## üß© What is an Interactive Prototype?

An interactive prototype is a clickable or animated version of a design that replicates the core functionality and navigation of a product.

Unlike static mockups, prototypes allow users to:
- Click through screens and test flows.
- Experience transitions and feedback.
- Interact with dropdowns, buttons, modals, etc.

## üîÅ Prototyping Workflow

### 1. **Plan the Flow**
- Define the user story or scenario to simulate.
- Identify the screens required and their connections.

### 2. **Build Wireframes or High-Fidelity Screens**
- Use Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch.
- Organize screens on a shared canvas in a logical sequence.

### 3. **Add Interactions**
- Link buttons and elements to target frames.
- Define interactions: tap, hover, drag, press.
- Choose transitions: instant, dissolve, smart animate, etc.

### 4. **Test the Prototype**
- Preview the prototype to test logic and flow.
- Validate that all buttons lead to expected destinations.
- Check for broken links or missing screens.

### 5. **Share with Stakeholders or Users**
- Generate a shareable link with view/comment access.
- Use presentation mode or embed in documentation.
- Collect feedback for iteration.

## üõ† Tools for Prototyping

| Tool       | Strengths                          | Notes                                  |
|------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Figma      | Web-based, real-time collaboration | Smart Animate, version history         |
| Adobe XD   | Auto-Animate, voice interactions   | Strong integration with Adobe apps     |
| Sketch     | Linked symbols, design + prototype | Mac only, use with InVision or Framer  |
| ProtoPie   | Advanced logic & micro-interactions| Great for mobile, steep learning curve |

## üéØ Best Practices

- Start simple‚Äîonly prototype what needs testing.
- Use real or close-to-real content.
- Include microinteractions to enhance realism.
- Always test before presenting.

## üìå Use Cases

- Usability testing sessions
- Design reviews with stakeholders
- Development handoff demos
- Portfolio presentation and case studies
