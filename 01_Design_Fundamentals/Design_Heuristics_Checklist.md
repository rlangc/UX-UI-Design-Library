# Design Heuristics Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate and improve the usability of your interface. These heuristics are adapted from Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 Usability Heuristics and other human-centered design best practices.

## âœ… Usability Heuristics

### 1. **Visibility of System Status**
- [ ] Users receive immediate feedback for their actions.
- [ ] Loading indicators, confirmations, or progress bars are present.
- [ ] Errors and successes are clearly communicated.

### 2. **Match Between System and the Real World**
- [ ] Language is user-friendly, not system-oriented.
- [ ] Icons and visuals follow familiar real-world conventions.
- [ ] Labels and structure reflect user mental models.

### 3. **User Control and Freedom**
- [ ] Users can easily undo or redo actions.
- [ ] Back buttons or exit points are clearly visible.
- [ ] Modals or overlays can be dismissed intuitively.

### 4. **Consistency and Standards**
- [ ] UI components behave similarly across screens.
- [ ] Colors, typography, and spacing follow a consistent system.
- [ ] Platform and web conventions are respected.

### 5. **Error Prevention**
- [ ] Forms include field validation and constraints.
- [ ] Irreversible actions require confirmation.
- [ ] Default settings minimize potential errors.

### 6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall**
- [ ] Navigation is visible and clearly labeled.
- [ ] Users do not have to remember steps or codes.
- [ ] Help text or suggestions are contextually visible.

### 7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**
- [ ] Shortcuts or quick actions are available for experienced users.
- [ ] Repetitive actions can be performed in fewer steps.
- [ ] Interfaces scale from novice to advanced user needs.

### 8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**
- [ ] Only relevant content and controls are displayed.
- [ ] Visual clutter is avoided.
- [ ] Layout emphasizes clarity and hierarchy.

### 9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**
- [ ] Error messages are clear, concise, and constructive.
- [ ] Help links or suggestions accompany error states.
- [ ] Visual cues (e.g., red outlines, icons) support error recovery.

### 10. **Help and Documentation**

- [ ] Tooltips, walkthroughs, or onboarding guides are present.
- [ ] FAQ or help center links are provided for complex interactions.
