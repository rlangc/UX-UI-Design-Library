# Component Library

This document outlines the core components used throughout your design system. A well-maintained component library improves consistency, scalability, and collaboration between design and development teams.

## ðŸ§© What is a Component?

A component is a reusable building block used across screens and flows. Each one includes defined states, variations, and usage rules. Components may also be nested within other components (e.g., icons in buttons, fields in forms).

---

## ðŸ§° Tools

Reusable components = faster design, cleaner code, and better user experience.
