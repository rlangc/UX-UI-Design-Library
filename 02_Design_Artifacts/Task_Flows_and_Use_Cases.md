# Task Flows and Use Cases

Task flows and use cases help map out the key steps users take to complete specific goals within a system. These artifacts are essential for understanding functionality, navigation paths, and usability constraints during design and development.

## 🔄 What is a Task Flow?

A **task flow** is a simplified visual or textual representation of a user completing a single goal through your product. It focuses on the core steps and interactions required.

### 🧭 Example: Task Flow – "Start a Lesson"

2. Tap "Continue Learning" on dashboard.
3. Browse available lessons.
4. Tap lesson title to open it.
5. Press "Play" to begin video/audio.
6. Complete interactive quiz (if applicable).
7. Tap "Mark Complete" and return to dashboard.

## 🧾 What is a Use Case?

A **use case** outlines how a user interacts with a system to accomplish a specific task. It often includes the actor, system behavior, and variations.

- **Main Flow:**
  1. Emma browses the course catalog.
  2. She taps the bookmark icon on a course card.
  3. The system saves the course to her profile under "Saved Courses".
- **Postconditions:** Emma sees the course listed in her "Saved" section.
- **Alternative Flows:** If Emma is not logged in, she is prompted to sign in first.
