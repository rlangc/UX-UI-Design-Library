# Empathy Maps

Empathy maps help teams understand the user’s mindset, feelings, and environment by organizing insights into four main quadrants. They are typically created early in the design process and are especially useful after user interviews or field research.

## 🧠 What is an Empathy Map?

An empathy map is a visual framework used to capture what a user **says**, **thinks**, **does**, and **feels** during their experience with a product or while trying to solve a problem. It brings clarity to user motivations, guiding more user-centered solutions.

## ✍️ Example: Jordan – Aspiring Developer

### **SAYS**
- “I want to build a real portfolio.”
- “I’m not sure where to start with UX.”

### **THINKS**
- “Am I wasting time on this course?”
- “This UI looks outdated… is it still relevant?”

### **DOES**
- Browses free UX resources on YouTube.
- Enrolls in multiple short courses but doesn’t always finish them.

### **FEELS**
- Anxious about job competition.
- Excited when a lesson is hands-on and clear.

## 🔧 How to Use an Empathy Map

1. **Start with a persona** or real interview subject.
2. **Draw four quadrants** labeled: Says, Thinks, Does, Feels.
3. **Fill in each quadrant** using direct quotes, observations, and inferred thoughts or emotions.
4. **Look for patterns** across multiple maps to inform product strategy.
